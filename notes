I am going to dump my thoughts and what to work on/ change / implement here for now
will eventually add this as functionality to the main page

..Today I complted Wes Bos's Flexbox tutorial and now have a better understand of how flexbox works
.Flex containers and then flex items are more clear to me now
.The main axis and the cross axis is a big part of what i wasn't getting
.I am still unsure however on when to sue flexbox and when to use grid so next up I want to complete Wes's grid tutorial
.I have began to moduleify and structure my blog in a more clear and standardized way
.Importing and exporting with node.js I was able to succefully transplant the etch-a-sketch javascirpt
.Next up is the gallery, it needs some css added aswell
